# lmc-base-classes

## About
A shared repository for the Local Monitoring and Control (LMC) Base Classes. The goal is to create a Software Development Kit for the Control System of the [Square Kilometre Array](http://skatelescope.org/) (SKA) radio telescope project. The Telescope Manager provides the Central Control System and each _Element_ provides a Local Control System that all work together as the Control System for the instrument. In the SKA case _Elements_ are subsystems such as the Central Signal Processor (CSP), Science Data Processor (SDP), Dishes (DSH), Low-Frequency Apperture Array (LFAA) etc.  Control is implement using the distributed control system, [TANGO](http://www.tango-controls.org), which is accessed from Python using the [PyTango](https://github.com/tango-controls/pytango) package.

Early work in this repo was done as part of the LMC Base Classes Evolutionary Prototype (LEvPro) project, under the INDO-SA collaboration program.
